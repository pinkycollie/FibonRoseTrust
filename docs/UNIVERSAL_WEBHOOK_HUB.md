# Universal Webhook Hub for FibonroseTrust

The Universal Webhook Hub serves as a cross-cutting middleware layer that facilitates communication between all components of the FibonroseTrust Decentralized Identity Framework and external systems.

## Architecture Overview

The webhook system uses an event-driven architecture with the following key components:

1. **Event Bus**: Centralized message broker that connects all framework layers
2. **Webhook Manager**: Handles webhook delivery, retry logic, and security
3. **Trust-Based Filtering**: Uses Fibonacci trust levels to control data exposure
4. **Security Integration**: Connects with NegraRosa Security Framework

## Integration Points with Identity Framework

The webhook hub connects across all layers of the identity verification flow:

1. **Identity Verification Layer**
   - Trigger events: `verification.initiated`, `verification.completed`
   - External notifications for verification attempts and results

2. **Neural Network Processing**
   - Events: `neural.risk_assessment_started`, `neural.risk_assessment_completed`
   - Integration with external fraud detection systems

3. **Decentralized Database**
   - Events: `db.data_stored`, `db.data_updated`, `db.data_accessed`
   - Data synchronization with external systems

4. **Credential Validation**
   - Events: `credential.validation_started`, `credential.validation_completed`
   - Security alerts for suspicious validation attempts

5. **Access Rights Management**
   - Events: `access.granted`, `access.revoked`, `permission.level_changed`
   - Permission change notifications to external systems

## Fibonacci Trust-Based Filtering

The webhook system utilizes the FibonroseTrust progressive trust model to filter sensitive data based on Fibonacci trust levels:

1. **Trust Levels 1-3** (Basic)
   - Limited data access
   - Personal, biometric, financial data removed
   - Only basic verification status shared

2. **Trust Levels 4-7** (Intermediate)
   - More data access with sensitive fields obscured
   - Personal data included but sensitive fields redacted
   - Biometric results still excluded

3. **Trust Levels 8-12** (Advanced)
   - Most data included with minimal redaction
   - Only highest-sensitivity fields obscured

4. **Trust Levels 13+** (Full)
   - Complete data access
   - No filtering applied

This progressive filtering ensures that external systems only receive data appropriate to their trust level, following the Fibonacci growth pattern that underpins the entire FibonroseTrust system.

## Xano Integration for The-PinkSync

The webhook hub includes specialized integration with Xano (x8ki-letl-twmt.n7.xano.io) and The-PinkSync:

- Custom webhook handlers for Xano format compatibility
- Event type mapping between FibonroseTrust and PinkSync
- Specialized payload transformations
- Structured metadata API integration

## Security Features

The webhook system implements several security measures:

1. **HMAC Signature Verification**
   - All outgoing webhooks are signed with HMAC-SHA256
   - Webhook secrets are unique to each subscription

2. **NegraRosa Security WHY Integration**
   - High-risk webhooks require WHY verification
   - Intent verification for sensitive operations

3. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - Automatic disabling of webhooks with high failure rates
   - Protection against malicious endpoints

4. **Transport Security**
   - TLS for all webhook deliveries
   - Timeout and rate limiting controls

## Management Features

The hub provides comprehensive management capabilities:

1. **Subscription Management**
   - Create, update, and delete webhook subscriptions
   - Filter subscriptions by event type or source

2. **Delivery Monitoring**
   - Track webhook delivery history
   - View request/response details for troubleshooting

3. **Import/Export**
   - CSV import/export of webhook subscriptions
   - Bulk management of webhook configurations

4. **Testing Tools**
   - Test webhook deliveries with sample payloads
   - Verify endpoint compatibility
