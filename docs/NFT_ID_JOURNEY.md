# FibonroseTrust NFT ID Journey: Technical Overview & User Flow

## Technical Architecture Overview

The FibonroseTrust identity system is built with a multi-layered architecture that combines traditional identity verification with blockchain technology to produce a secure NFT ID card.

### Key Technical Components:

1. **Identity Verification Layer**
   - Authentication system using Auth0 for initial identity validation
   - Biometric verification component for physical identity confirmation
   - Document validation services for credential verification

2. **Neural Network Processing**
   - Risk assessment algorithms analyzing verification data
   - Anomaly detection for spotting fraudulent verification attempts
   - Trust scoring using Fibonacci sequence-based progressive model

3. **Decentralized Database**
   - Secure storage of verification records and attestations
   - Distributed validation of identity claims
   - Event-based synchronization with on-chain records

4. **Credential Validation**
   - Verification of external credentials and attestations
   - Integration with Civic Pass verification service
   - Multi-factor validation requirements based on risk assessment

5. **Access Rights Management**
   - Trust-based permission controls using Fibonacci levels
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types
   - Consent management system for data sharing

6. **Universal Webhook Hub** (Cross-cutting)
   - Event-driven notification system connecting all components
   - Trust-level based data filtering for external communications
   - Integration with external systems like Xano and PinkSync

7. **NFT Minting Engine**
   - Smart contract integration for NFT generation
   - 3D virtual card rendering using Three.js
   - On-chain verification of identity attestations

## User Journey: "I Am Who I Am" NFT ID Card

### 1. Registration & Initial Authentication (Identity Verification Layer)

**User Experience:**
- User creates an account through the FibonroseTrust platform
- Completes basic profile information with email, name, and contact details
- Receives verification email through Auth0 integration
- Sets up multi-factor authentication for account security

**Technical Background:**
- Auth0 integration handles initial identity verification
- User data is encrypted and stored securely
- NegraRosa's Security Framework establishes initial trust baseline
- Webhook events (`user.created`, `verification.initiated`) trigger next steps

### 2. Identity Verification Process (Identity Verification & Neural Network Layers)

**User Experience:**
- User is prompted to complete a series of verification steps
- Uploads government-issued ID document for scanning
- Performs biometric verification (facial recognition matching ID)
- Completes "WHY verification" process to establish reason for identity verification
- Answers security questions for additional verification

**Technical Background:**
- Document verification APIs validate ID authenticity
- Biometric verification ensures liveness and matches ID photo
- Neural network processes verification data for risk assessment
- Trust score is calculated using Fibonacci algorithm
- Webhook events (`verification.step_completed`, `neural.risk_assessment_completed`) track progress

### 3. Civic Pass Integration (Credential Validation Layer)

**User Experience:**
- User connects cryptocurrency wallet for Civic Pass verification
- Authorizes identity verification check through Civic Pass system
- Receives confirmation of on-chain verification status
- Views verification status in their dashboard

**Technical Background:**
- Wallet connection establishes blockchain identity link
- Civic Pass integration performs on-chain verification
- Verification results are stored in decentralized database
- Trust score is adjusted based on verification results
- Webhook events (`wallet.connected`, `civic.pass_verified`) notify all systems

### 4. Trust Level Determination (Access Rights Management Layer)

**User Experience:**
- User sees their current Fibonacci trust level (1-21+)
- Views what access rights and permissions this level grants
- Can see what verification steps would increase their trust level
- Manages consent for data sharing based on trust level

**Technical Background:**
- Fibonacci trust scoring combines all verification factors
- Access rights matrix determines permissions at each level
- Data sharing controls filter information based on trust level
- Webhook events (`trust_score.updated`, `permission.level_changed`) notify relevant systems

### 5. NFT ID Card Creation (NFT Minting Engine)

**User Experience:**
- User reaches the trust threshold required for NFT ID minting (typically level 5+)
- Views preview of their 3D virtual NFT ID card with verification status
- Authorizes minting process using their connected wallet
- Receives confirmation when NFT is successfully minted

**Technical Background:**
- Three.js engine generates visual representation of NFT ID card
- Smart contract interaction mints the NFT to user's wallet
- On-chain verification metadata is attached to the NFT
- Trust level, verification status, and expiration date encoded in metadata
- Webhook events (`nft.minted`) notify all connected systems

### 6. Ongoing Verification & Trust Growth (Continuous Cycle)

**User Experience:**
- User can view their NFT ID card in wallet and on platform
- Sees trust score increase as they complete additional verifications
- Receives notifications for verification renewals or updates
- Can share their verification status with third parties (controlled by trust level)

**Technical Background:**
- Ongoing verification checks maintain NFT validity
- Trust level can increase through additional verification types
- Expiring credentials trigger update notifications
- Webhook events enable third-party integration for verification checks
- Universal Webhook Hub applies trust-based filtering for all external communications

## Result: "I Am Who I Am" NFT Identity Token

The final NFT ID card serves as a portable, cryptographically secure verification of the user's identity, with:

1. A visual 3D representation of their identity card
2. On-chain verification status that can be checked by third parties
3. Progressive trust level based on the Fibonacci sequence
4. Secure, consent-based sharing of verification status
5. Integration with external systems through the Universal Webhook Hub

This creates a self-sovereign identity solution where users can truly say "I Am Who I Am" with cryptographic proof, while maintaining control of their data through the FibonroseTrust framework.
