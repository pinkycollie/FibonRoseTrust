well-structured Decentralized Identity Framework plan and access to Xano's Metadata API.

Integration Strategy Based on Your Screenshots
Looking at your implementation strategy and current architecture, here's how we can combine Civic Pass integration with your existing plans:

1. Aligning with Your 5-Phase Implementation
Your first screenshot shows a 5-phase implementation plan:

First Phase: Event Taxonomy Enhancement
We can extend this to include Civic Pass verification events
Add specific event types for identity verification status changes
Second Phase: Event Emitters
Add Civic Pass-specific event emitters that trigger when:
A user connects their wallet
A Civic Pass is verified
Verification status changes
Third Phase: Fibonacci Trust-based Data Filtering
This aligns perfectly with Civic Pass's trust levels
We can use Civic Pass verification status as a factor in your trust calculations
Fourth Phase: NegraSecurity Integration with WHY Verification
Civic Pass can be integrated here as an additional verification layer
This provides blockchain-backed verification to complement your WHY verification
Fifth Phase: Xano/PinkSync Integration
Use the Xano Metadata API (shown in your third screenshot) to store verification metadata
Create specialized endpoints for Civic Pass verification status
2. Integration with Your Identity Flow
Your second screenshot shows a perfect flow for Civic Pass integration:

User Input → Identity Verification Layer → Neural Network Processing → 
Decentralized Database → Credential Validation → Access Rights Management
Civic Pass would integrate at both the Identity Verification Layer and the Credential Validation steps:

Identity Verification Layer:
Add wallet connection capability
Implement Civic Pass verification check
Store verification status
Credential Validation:
Use on-chain verification of Civic Pass
Implement different validation paths based on pass type
3. Leveraging Xano's Metadata API
Your third screenshot shows the Xano Metadata API which is perfect for this integration:

// Integration between Civic validation and Xano Metadata API
async function storeCivicVerificationInXano(userId: string, walletAddress: string, 
                                           verificationStatus: any): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    // Use xanoIntegrationService to connect to Metadata API
    const response = await xanoIntegrationService.metadataAPI.post('/user_verification', {
      user_id: userId,
      wallet_address: walletAddress,
      civic_verification: {
        status: verificationStatus.status,
        pass_type: verificationStatus.type,
        verified_at: new Date().toISOString(),
        trust_level: calculateTrustLevel(verificationStatus)
      }
    });
    
    return response.success;
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Failed to store Civic verification in Xano', error);
    return false;
  }
}
// Calculate trust level based on Fibonacci sequence and verification status
function calculateTrustLevel(verificationStatus: any): number {
  // Implementation of your Fibonacci trust algorithm
  // This connects your existing trust system with Civic verification
}
Technical Implementation Plan
Here's a detailed plan focusing only on the realistically doable aspects:

Phase 1: Core Civic Pass Integration (2-4 weeks)
Wallet Connection:
Implement wallet connection in the frontend (MetaMask, Phantom, etc.)
Store connected wallet addresses in user profiles
Basic Civic Pass Verification:
Add Civic Pass verification endpoints
Implement on-chain verification of passes
Event System Enhancement:
Add Civic-specific events to your event taxonomy
Implement event emitters for verification status changes
Phase 2: Trust System Integration (3-5 weeks)
Fibonacci Trust Integration:
Integrate Civic Pass verification status into your trust calculation
Implement different trust levels based on pass types
NegraSecurity Enhancement:
Add Civic Pass as a verification method in NegraSecurity
Implement rules for different verification types
Xano Metadata Storage:
Use Xano's Metadata API to store verification data
Create endpoints for querying verification status
Phase 3: Access Control Implementation (2-3 weeks)
RBAC Enhancement:
Update access control to consider Civic Pass status
Implement different access levels based on verification
UI Indicators:
Add visual indicators for verification status
Implement basic accessibility features in these indicators
