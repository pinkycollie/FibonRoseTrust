# Fibonrose Trust

## Comprehensive Verification & Trust System

## Overview

The Fibonrose Trust is a comprehensive verification and trust system designed to authenticate both:

1. **Sign language interpreters‚Äô** skills and experience for DEAF FIRST platform services
1. **Deaf individuals‚Äô** work experience, volunteering, and community contributions that often go unrecorded in traditional employment verification systems

This dual verification system addresses critical gaps where interpreters falsely claim ASL proficiency AND where deaf individuals‚Äô valuable deaf-centric work experience is invisible to mainstream employers and verification services like The Work Number.

## The Problem We Solve

### Current Issues

#### Interpreter-Related Problems

- **False Claims**: Interpreters misrepresenting their ASL skill levels and experience
- **Resume Fraud**: Inflated qualifications and fabricated work history
- **Service Exclusion**: Deaf individuals denied services due to poor interpreter quality
- **Lack of Accountability**: No centralized system to verify interpreter credentials
- **Cultural Incompetence**: Interpreters without true understanding of deaf culture and community needs

#### Deaf Employment Verification Problems

- **Invisible Work History**: Deaf-centric jobs, volunteering, and community work not reported to The Work Number or traditional employment databases
- **Undervalued Experience**: Community leadership, deaf organization work, and volunteer contributions not recognized by mainstream employers
- **Documentation Gaps**: Years of valuable experience in deaf community roles lacking formal verification
- **Career Advancement Barriers**: Unable to prove extensive community and professional experience

### Impact on Deaf Community
